### Technical Experience, Project
<ul>
  <li>Grizzly Paths, Data Science Capstone: Collaborated in a team of 4 to develop an interactive website and chatbot that helps students identify key skills for IT majors and recommends career paths based on user input, utilizing Vue.js and Flask. Conducted data analysis and developed a chatbot that enhanced user engagement through job recommendations, dynamic visualizations, and an interactive interface. </li>
  <li>STEC 4500 Undergraduate Research Project: Leveraged a machine learning algorithm on time-series neural data to identify event patterns in electrophysiological signals to predict post-synaptic events. Designed and implemented a MATLAB workflow for preprocessing and analyzing high-frequency biomedical signals. </li>
  <li>Autobots, Technology Ambassador Program: Collaborated with a team of 3 to develop a machine learning teaching incentive using mBot, where students trained an image recognition model to navigate a maze, providing hands-on experience with AI challenges. Led interactive demonstrations that encouraged students to create their image datasets (including hand gestures) to train the model, enhancing their understanding of machine learning concepts. </li>
  <li>Corvue, Hacklytics at Georgia Tech: Collaborated in developing a Convolutional Neural Network model using CT scan images to predict the presence of Coronary Artery Disease, achieving an accuracy of 85% of new images. Collaborated with team members to troubleshoot technical challenges and coordinate project execution, ensuring timely completion and successful integration of individual contributions.</li>
