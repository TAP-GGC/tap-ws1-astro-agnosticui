desc:  "Hi, I'm Rebecca Rahman, I am majoring in Marketing with a passion for creative strategy and analytical thinking. I have a strong academic foundation, thanks in part to dual enrollment, and I've excelled in subjects like Business Management, Marketing, Economics & Social Sciences,and  Psychology.
  One of my favorite projects was leading A.I. Diva for the Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) a sassy AI chatbot designed to teach others about proper AI usage in real-world contexts. I'm especially interested in the ethical and practical aspects of AI, including issues like misrepresentation, plagiarism, and false representation.
  I love working on projects that connect culture, language, and data. On the tech side, I've been studying computer programming and incorporating it into my academic and creative work. I recently developed a reflective journal in the style of a Scout project proposals well as a STaRS poster
  A fun fact about me favorite color is that my favorite color is baby blue!"
