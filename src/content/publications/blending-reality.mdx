abstract: "Our project aims to provide a snapshot of the possibilities of Augmented Reality (AR) art creation using Adobe Aero within a limited timeframe, offering participants a taste of their creative potential within augmented reality. We introduce different types of audiences, ranging from middle schoolers to college students, to the world of AR via several workshops. We plan to survey our audiences, then analyze the results of these surveys and present the results of our endeavor in our poster."
