Roblox is more than just a game platform that is also a development environment where students can build their own multiplayer games and experiences. Using Roblox Studio and Lua scripting, TAP students create custom characters, mechanics, and environments from the ground up.

### 🕹️ What Students Have Created with Roblox

TAP students have used Roblox Studio to design battle arenas, obstacle courses, and exploration-based multiplayer games. In *Virtual Warriors*, students scripted health systems, power-ups, and multiplayer events using Lua while designing immersive 3D maps. They also tested their games in real time with classmates—gaining experience in logic, flow control, and teamwork.

Students learn to use object hierarchies, trigger zones, event-based code, and in-game UI—all within a beginner-friendly editor.
