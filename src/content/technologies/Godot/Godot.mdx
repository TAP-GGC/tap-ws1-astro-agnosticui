Godot is a free and open-source game engine known for its flexibility, especially in 2D game development. It features a scene-based architecture, built-in animation tools, and support for GDScript, a Python-like language. Students use Godot in the TAP program to build projects that emphasize creative interaction, modularity, and player feedback.

### ðŸŽ® What Students Have Created with Godot

TAP students have used Godot to create custom physics engines, visual puzzles, exploratory games, and multi-scene simulations. With its lightweight interface and powerful scripting, Godot is a popular choice for intermediate developers ready to move beyond block-based platforms.

<br/>

<b>Godot helps TAP students explore real-world game design principlesâ€”like collision handling, scene trees, and sprite animationâ€”while building projects that are lightweight, playable, and uniquely their own.</b>
