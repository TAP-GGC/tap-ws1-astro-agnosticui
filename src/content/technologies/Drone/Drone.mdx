Drones offer TAP students a dynamic platform to explore flight, robotics, and programming. By combining hardware operation with code, students gain hands-on experience with sensors, altitude control, navigation, and safety constraints. Drones are especially effective for showcasing real-time responsiveness and spatial awareness in coding.

### ðŸ›¸ What Students Have Created with Drones

TAP drone projects often simulate real-life scenarios, like delivery systems, obstacle courses, and search-and-rescue operations. Students program drones to execute timed maneuvers, react to sensor input, and interact with environments in creative, mission-based challenges.

<b>Drones provide an engaging way to bring abstract coding concepts into the physical world - bridging logic with movement, automation, and control.</b>
