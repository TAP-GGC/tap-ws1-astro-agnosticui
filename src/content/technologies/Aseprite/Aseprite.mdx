Aseprite is a dedicated tool for creating pixel art and animated sprites. It provides a timeline editor, onion skinning, and a customizable grid systemâ€”making it ideal for 2D game development. In the TAP program, students use Aseprite to create characters, backgrounds, icons, and UI elements that power their interactive media projects.

### ðŸŽ® What Students Have Created with Aseprite

In *PixelArcade*, students designed retro-themed characters, tilesets, and collectible icons, all animated frame by frame using Aseprite. *Pizza Heist* featured stealth-inspired character movement and sprite-based transitions created entirely within Asepriteâ€™s timeline editor.

Aseprite supports exporting sprite sheets and GIFs, which students then import into Unity, Godot, or Scratch for use in actual gameplay.
