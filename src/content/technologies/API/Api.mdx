APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow projects to communicate with external platforms by sending and receiving data. In TAP, students use APIs to power real-world functionalityâ€”such as fetching chatbot responses, retrieving live data, or submitting form inputs to a server.

### ðŸ”Œ What Students Have Created with APIs

In *AiDiva*, students used an AI text-generation API to give personality and dynamic conversation to a fictional AI influencer. Other TAP projects have used APIs for joke generators, quote of the day feeds, music control, and news updatesâ€”all fetched in real time.

Projects typically involve making HTTP requests (GET or POST), parsing JSON, and handling asynchronous behavior using JavaScript or Python.
