Processing is an open-source creative coding platform designed for visual artists, designers, and students. Itâ€™s widely used in the TAP program to explore animation, simulation, and creative logic through code. With its simplified Java-like syntax, students can create visually rich experiences from scratch.

### ðŸŽ¨ What Students Have Created with Processing

TAP students have used Processing to design generative art, build arcade-style games, and experiment with interactive visualizations. In *Alien Invader*, students created a space-themed shooter using keyboard controls and custom sprites. *Fruit Rain* was reimagined in Processing for smoother animation and better collision handling. *Artify AI* blended procedural visuals with AI-generated prompts to create interactive artwork.

Processing projects emphasize math, timing, and logic while offering immediate visual feedbackâ€”making it perfect for developing problem-solving and creative expression skills.
