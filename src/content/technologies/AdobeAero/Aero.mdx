Adobe Aero allows students to create interactive augmented reality (AR) experiences using 2D and 3D assets. With an intuitive interface and no-code animation logic, Aero empowers creators to anchor visuals in physical space, add movement, and define how users interact with digital layers through mobile devices.

### ðŸ§Š What Students Have Created with Adobe Aero

In projects like *Blending Reality*, students designed 3D scenes in Blender and imported them into Adobe Aero to create layered AR exhibits. These experiences allowed viewers to move around a physical space while triggering animations, camera angles, or object behaviorâ€”all through their phones or tablets.

Students use Aero to prototype interactive installations, storytelling vignettes, and concept art that blends physical presence with digital imagination.
