mBlock is a coding environment designed to teach programming and robotics through visual, block-based logic. Built on Scratch, mBlock supports both beginner-friendly coding and advanced extensions with Python or Arduino. It integrates seamlessly with Makeblock hardware such as mBot, allowing students to write logic for real-world movement, sensors, and reactions.

### ðŸ”§ What Students Have Created with mBlock

In *Autobots*, students used mBlock to program custom logic for autonomous robots. They coded obstacle detection, directional changes, and conditional responses using drag-and-drop blocks tied to real hardware. Some also experimented with mBlockâ€™s AI extensions, like text recognition or facial tracking.

TAP students use mBlock to bridge code and physical behaviorâ€”developing foundational understanding of logic, automation, and robotics.
