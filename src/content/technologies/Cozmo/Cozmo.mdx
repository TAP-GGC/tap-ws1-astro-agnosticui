Cozmo is a small but powerful robot developed by Anki that can recognize faces, explore environments, and respond emotionally to interactions. Students use Cozmo to dive into robotics, artificial intelligence, and creative coding.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use Cozmo

1. Connect Cozmo to a mobile device running the **Cozmo SDK** or **Code Lab** app.
2. Use block-based programming (similar to Scratch) or Python through the SDK.
3. Cozmo can:

    - Recognize faces and objects
    - Drive around using treads
    - Speak and animate expressions
    - Stack cubes and detect collisions



### üéì What Students Have Created with Cozmo

#### üß† Wanda  
In this project, students programmed Cozmo to behave like a personal wellness assistant named Wanda. Cozmo asks how the user is feeling, reacts with facial animations, and offers encouragement or jokes depending on the response. It mixes sentiment detection with storytelling and emotional expression.

<br/>

<b>Cozmo makes robotics approachable by giving students an expressive, programmable character to bring stories and logic to life. It's an ideal entry point into AI, physical computing, and Python-based development.</b>
