Glitch is a browser-based development platform that allows students to build and instantly deploy full-stack web applications. Its remixable projects, built-in hosting, and support for Node.js make it a fast and accessible tool for coding, testing, and sharing web experiences.

### 🌐 What Students Have Created with Glitch

In *TapIn*, students used Glitch to develop a web-based resource hub backed by custom APIs and connected to NFC tags. Glitch allowed them to manage routes, store content, and push updates live without needing to set up a traditional server.

Glitch is especially popular in TAP for student-built APIs, JavaScript-based sites, and rapid web development.
