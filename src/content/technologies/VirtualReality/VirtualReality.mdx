Virtual Reality (VR) empowers students to build digital experiences that feel physicalâ€”environments where users can walk, interact, and explore in 360 degrees. In the TAP program, students use VR as both a creative outlet and a technical challenge, combining spatial design, logic, and storytelling into one immersive platform.

### ðŸ§  What Students Have Created in Virtual Reality

Projects like *Virtual Warriors* challenged students to design explorable combat arenas with movement controls, immersive audio, and responsive physics. Whether built in Unity or Roblox, these VR games allowed users to interact with objects, battle AI enemies, and navigate in fully 3D environments through headsets and handheld controllers.

Students working with VR gain insight into player perspective, camera control, 3D collisions, and interface limitationsâ€”skills critical in todayâ€™s interactive tech landscape.
