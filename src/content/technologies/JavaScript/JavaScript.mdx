JavaScript is a scripting language used to bring interactivity and real-time behavior to websites. In TAP, students use JavaScript to build interactive games, link APIs, animate elements, and control page behavior based on user actions.

### ⚙️ What Students Have Created with JavaScript

Projects like *AiDiva* used JavaScript to link to external APIs and manage dynamic personality responses on a single-page site. In *Foes*, students implemented mouse-based movement and event listeners to drive gameplay. *TapIn* used JavaScript to trigger NFC redirection, page animations, and responsive interactions.

Students gain experience with variables, conditionals, functions, and event-driven programming—all core skills for web development.
