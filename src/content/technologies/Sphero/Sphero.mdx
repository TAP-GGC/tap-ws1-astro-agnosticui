Sphero is a spherical robot that moves, spins, flashes, and reacts to programmed commands. It‚Äôs widely used in classrooms to teach beginner-to-intermediate coding, physics, geometry, and storytelling through hands-on robotics.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use Sphero

- Connect your Sphero robot via Bluetooth to a tablet or computer.

- Use the <strong>Sphero Edu app</strong> to create programs using:
  <ul>
    <li>Block-based code (like Scratch)</li>
    <li>JavaScript text mode</li>
    <li>Drawing mode (ideal for younger students)</li>
  </ul>

- Programs control Sphero‚Äôs:
  <ul>
    <li>Speed and direction</li>
    <li>LED lights and sounds</li>
    <li>Reactions to collisions or tilts</li>
  </ul>


#### üì± Required Software

* <a href="https://edu.sphero.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sphero Edu App</a> (iOS, Android, web)
* Optional: Google Drive for logging data or designing obstacle courses



### üéì What Students Have Created with Sphero

#### üèÄ Ball Is Life  
A basketball-themed Sphero game where students program the robot to follow a dribbling pattern and shoot into a physical hoop. The project combines physics, sports, and precise motor control.

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Jedi Training  
Students transformed the Sphero into a lightsaber training bot. They programmed it to dodge, charge, and flash colors based on player movements, using sensors to simulate lightsaber battles.



<b>Sphero gives students a fun and tangible way to apply coding to the physical world. It sparks curiosity and builds confidence through movement-based logic, storytelling, and gamified robotics.</b>
