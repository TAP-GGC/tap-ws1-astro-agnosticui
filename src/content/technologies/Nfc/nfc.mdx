Near Field Communication (NFC) technology allows short-range wireless communication between a chip and a mobile device. In the TAP program, students use NFC tags to add interactivity to physical displays, business cards, and classroom installations.

### ðŸ“² What Students Have Created with NFC

In *TapIn*, students integrated NFC chips into printed handouts and displays, allowing new TAP members to tap their phones and instantly access curated digital content. The result was a low-cost, high-impact solution that combined hardware and web development into a seamless onboarding experience.

Students learn how to write data to NFC tags, associate them with links, and consider user experience in physical-digital interfaces.
