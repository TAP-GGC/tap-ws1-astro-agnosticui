Makey Makey is a creative electronics kit that transforms bananas, aluminum foil, or even water into computer keys and controllers. It works by completing simple circuits through touch, making it a favorite for hands-on, inventive, and accessible projects.

### ⚙️ How to Use Makey Makey

1. Connect the Makey Makey board to your computer via USB.
2. Clip alligator wires to conductive materials (like fruit, coins, or foil).
3. Open any program (like Scratch or Tynker) or just use the keyboard.
4. Touch the object — it behaves like pressing a key (arrow, space, etc.).

💡 You do not need to write code to get started. But combining it with Scratch or Arduino opens even more possibilities.
