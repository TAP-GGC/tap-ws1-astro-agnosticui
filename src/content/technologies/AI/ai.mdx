Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables students to create systems that respond intelligently to inputâ€”whether that means generating text, making decisions, or navigating digital environments. In TAP, AI appears both in creative tools like OpenAI and in custom-coded logic for autonomous agents and in-game behaviors.

### ðŸ¤– What Students Have Created with AI

In *AiDiva*, students integrated a generative AI model to give personality and dialogue to a virtual influencer, creating dynamic interactions that responded to user prompts. *Autobots* explored custom logic for character behavior, where in-game agents made decisions and navigated environments independently.

AI is used in TAP to power chatbots, story generators, learning games, and simulated intelligenceâ€”offering students a glimpse into how real-world AI tools work behind the scenes.
