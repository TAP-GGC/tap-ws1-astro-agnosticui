Scratch is a beginner-friendly programming platform developed by MIT that uses drag-and-drop code blocks to teach logic, sequencing, and interactivity. It’s a favorite among TAP students for rapid prototyping, creative storytelling, and building games.

### 🧩 How to Use Scratch

- Visit <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratch.mit.edu</a> and create a free account
- Create projects using color-coded blocks that snap together like puzzle pieces
- Control:
  - Movement
  - Animation
  - Sound
  - Events and variables

Scratch supports:
- Sprites and stage backgrounds
- Broadcasting between objects
- Logic, loops, and basic math

#### 🧰 Optional Tools

- USB camera or microphone (for interaction)
- Makey Makey or micro:bit for physical integration



### 🎓 What Students Have Created with Scratch

#### 🍬 Candy Catch  
A colorful arcade-style game where players move a sprite to catch falling candy using arrow keys or Makey Makey input.

#### 🌎 Leap for Mankind  
An educational animation exploring space travel and human achievement using character dialogue, narration, and sound effects.

#### 🏁 Makey’s Race  
A racing game controlled by Makey Makey where the player guides a Scratch sprite around obstacles using physical touchpads.

#### 🧟 Monster Makey  
An interactive Scratch story that triggers different monster animations based on real-world object input using Makey Makey.

#### 🌿 Planimals  
A logic-based game that teaches classification of animals and plants through interactive quizzes and sprite movement.

#### 💡 Light Up!  
A visual puzzle where players turn on virtual lights by connecting sequences and triggering conditional logic blocks.

#### 🛠 Space Mechanic  
A team-based Scratch game in which players repair spaceship components using custom buttons and Scratch broadcasts for teamwork.



<b>Scratch opens up the world of programming through creativity and accessibility. TAP students use it to bring stories, science, and games to life—with or without any prior coding experience.</b>
