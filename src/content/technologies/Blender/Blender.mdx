Blender is a professional-grade open-source platform for creating 3D art, animation, and visual effects. In TAP, students use Blender to design models for use in Unity, VR projects, and cinematic videos. They learn essential digital art skills while also exploring pipelines used in game development and animation studios.

### ðŸŒ€ What Students Have Created with Blender

In *Blending Reality*, students modeled original 3D environments and animated objects for use in a VR storytelling experience. Blender allowed them to sculpt terrain, animate cameras, and render sequences that enhanced the visual depth of their project.

Blender projects often include texture mapping, rigging, object hierarchies, and exporting to formats like `.fbx` and `.glb`â€”making them fully compatible with Unity or WebXR for use in VR and interactive scenes.

Students who combine Blender with Unity or Roblox VR development learn how to optimize mesh quality, apply materials that render correctly in immersive space, and place assets within 3D coordinates that align with gameplay or narrative logic.
