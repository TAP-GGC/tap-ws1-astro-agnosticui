HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. In the TAP program, students use HTML to build personal portfolios, interactive websites, and themed digital projects. With CSS for styling and sometimes JavaScript for interactivity, HTML empowers students to publish their work to the web.

### üåê What Students Have Created with HTML

TAP projects using HTML include digital art galleries, professional portfolios, and creative personal websites. In *AiDiva*, students crafted a dynamic landing page to showcase an AI-themed persona. *Webbie* offered a friendly portfolio with character-driven branding, while *TapIn* served as a class-curated resource hub for new TAP students.

Students learn to structure content with semantic HTML, link external resources, and combine CSS for layout and design polish.

<b>HTML gives students a lasting skill: the ability to design and deploy their ideas online, visible to anyone with a browser.</b>
