CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) lets students transform basic HTML into polished, visually engaging websites. It teaches them how to apply consistent styling across pages, manage responsive layouts, and create visual identity through color palettes, fonts, spacing, and animations.

### ðŸŽ¨ What Students Have Created with CSS

Projects like *AiDiva* used advanced styling and grid layouts to match a futuristic AI theme, while *Webbie* showcased playful branding with custom fonts and hover effects. In *TapIn*, students applied utility-focused styles to build a professional resource hub for incoming TAP members.

From button transitions to media queries, students gain an eye for user-friendly, creative design.



<b>CSS turns structural websites into expressive, user-ready experiencesâ€”bringing student ideas to life with thoughtful visual detail.</b>
