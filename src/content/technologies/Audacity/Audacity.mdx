Audacity is a free, professional-grade audio editor used to record and manipulate sound. In the TAP program, students use it to edit voiceovers, create audio effects, and layer background tracks to support their digital storytelling or game-based projects.

### ðŸŽ§ What Students Have Created with Audacity

Students used Audacity in *Monster Makey* to record monster voices, clean up ambient noise, and add pitch shifts for creative character effects. Audacity was also used to trim audio cues, build soundscapes, and export MP3s for integration into Scratch or Unity.

Through Audacity, students learn how to work with multi-track timelines, apply filters, and think critically about sound in user experiences.
