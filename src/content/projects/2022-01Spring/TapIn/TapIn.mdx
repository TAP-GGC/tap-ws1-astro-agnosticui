The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## About

This project introduces students to the basics of static web development through the creation of a digital business card. Using Glitch as the development platform and NFC chips for easy sharing, students will build personalized web pages that showcase their academic background, personal info, work or project experiences, goals, and social links. The result is a smart, modern way to network and share professional profiles with a simple tap — perfect for students looking to boost their digital presence.

NFC Chip - NFC (Near Field Communication) chips are small integrated circuits that enable short-range wireless communication between devices, facilitating contactless data transfer and transactions.

HTML, CSS, JS - Programming languages where HTML defines the content and structure of a webpage, CSS styles its presentation and layout, while JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic functionality.

Glitch - is a web-based platform that lets users build, remix, and share full-stack web apps directly in the browser. It’s beginner-friendly, supports real-time collaboration, and is great for quickly prototyping or learning to code with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
