## 📢 About

The objective of the workshop is to help those new to programming learn in a fun, fast-paced, munshroom themed setting.

This workshop has participants will answer questions involving programming fundamentals/ various knowledge to construct a tower, or to sabatoge their opponent's!

## 💡Project Information

Difficulty Level: Little to no coding experience required, but is preferred
Target Audience: 5th Grade and up
Duration of Workshop: 45 minutes - hour
Needed Materials: Computer, Internet access, required software and files: Godot.
Learning Outcomes: The primary goal of this project is to teach participants programming or other fundamentals in ITEC
Your Main Technology Godot, a free open source game engine used to develop 2D and 3D games/applications
Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## 📃 Project Description
Fungi Falls is a competitive, split-screen trivia game where two players race to build the tallest tower of fungi and rocks. It combines fast-paced quiz gameplay with physics-based strategy.

In this project, participants explore the creative side of game development. The game serves as a sandbox for a workshop where students learn to:

Design Assets: Create their own pixel-art rocks and mushrooms using external art tools.

Implement Physics: Import those assets into the Godot Engine and configure RigidBody2D and CollisionShape2D nodes to give them weight and physics properties.

Play & Compete: Use their custom creations in a live trivia battle, where answering questions correctly allows them to stack their new assets or sabotage their opponent's tower!

## 💻 Technology

Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so you can focus on making your game without reinventing the wheel.

Nodes & Scenes: Unlike block-based coding, Godot uses a unique "Node" and "Scene" architecture. Everything in the game—from a sound effect to a character to a level—is a "Scene" composed of "Nodes." This makes it incredibly intuitive for organizing complex game projects.

GDScript: The game is scripted using GDScript, a high-level, dynamically typed programming language used to create content. It uses a syntax similar to Python (blocks are indent-based and many keywords are similar).
