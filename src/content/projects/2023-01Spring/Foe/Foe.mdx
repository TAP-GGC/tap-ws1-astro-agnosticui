{/* Right text block, Project description */}	

The goal of this project is to educate others about JavaScript basics while building a HTML/CSS webpage.

Foes is a web-hosted project. This project is curated to peak the interest of non-IT and beginning IT majors. By participating in the workshop, student will get to experiment with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code to immediately view their changes on their browser.

 The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
