{/* Right text block, Project description */}

Using CoDrones, the aim of this project is to teach others about basic programming concepts through changing the behavior of the drones with block coding.

CoDrones are small and simple drones that are designed to be programmable in various languages including block coding and python.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Outreach Activities:
1. Classroom Workshops on Apr 14, Apr 20, and Apr 20, 2020: workshop demo to 1001 level IT students at GGC, to spark interests in IT and STEM

## Project Setup & Installation:
- [Download RokitBrick for CoDrone](https://robolink.co.kr/download_eng.html)

## Usage
<Photo src={Rokit.src} caption="Usage Example" />
- This window contains motion coding blocks that can be dragged and dropped in box 2.
- This is a programming script used to control the arrow pointer in box 3.
- This window contains the area of movement for the programmable arrow pointer.
- This window contains coding tabs to changing box 1 and contains tabs for RokitBrick settings.
