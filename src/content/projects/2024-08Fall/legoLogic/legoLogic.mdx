shortTitle: Lego Logic
title: Using Lego Spike Prime Sets to Teach Essential Coding Concepts
id: lego-logic
desc : This project utilizes LEGO SPIKE sets to create an interactive, educational experience aimed at teaching basic coding concepts through a hands-on workshop. Participants build and program a catapult to hit color-coded targets, simulating a carnival game. This engaging approach helps learners understand fundamental coding concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops.

{/* Right text block, Project description */}	

This project utilizes LEGO SPIKE sets to create an interactive, educational experience aimed at teaching basic coding concepts through a hands-on workshop. Participants build and program a catapult on wheels to hit color-coded targets, simulating a carnival game. This engaging approach helps learners understand fundamental coding concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops. The primary target audience for this workshop is students with little to no programming knowledge or experience, providing them with an introduction to coding and robotics in a fun, interactive way. Check out a demo of our project in action here: (To be added later)
