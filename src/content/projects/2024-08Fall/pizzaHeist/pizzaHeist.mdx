## About

  Pizza Heist introduces students to foundational cybersecurity concepts, including password protection, phishing, and virus identification. Through interactive discussions and an engaging game, participants learn how to safeguard personal digital data. Students will apply this knowledge by playing our game hosted on 'Itch.io', navigating a series of mini-games with the objective of avoiding cyber threats.

  Inspired by the rising number of cybersecurity threats, this project introduces an engaging cybersecurity game tailored for beginners. The game provides an interactive experience on essential cybersecurity topics, such as phishing, password security, viruses, and antivirus measures. Each mini-game is thoughtfully designed to teach these concepts in a fun and accessible way.
