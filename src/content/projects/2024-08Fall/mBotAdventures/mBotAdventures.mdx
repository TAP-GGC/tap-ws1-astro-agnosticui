shortTitle: mBot Adventures
title: Using robots to teach block coding and algorithmic thinking
id: mbot-adventures
desc :  Teaches basic coding fundamentals such as 'if-else' statements, forever loops, and booleans using block coding and the mBot's sensors. 
          The students will program a robot to perform basic movement, detect obstacles, and navigate through a track by developing block code that is uploaded to the robot.

{/* Right text block, Project description */}	

Our project uses mBot Mega to teach basic coding fundamentals (if-else statements, forever loops, and booleans) by programming a robot's sensors for movement.
We are using a physical robot to show a connection between the code in the digital space to an external, real-world device as a means of highlighting the vast capability of programming.
The students will program the mBot to perform simple movement, obstacle detection using its sensors, and traversing or racing through a track by uploading their block code to the mBot.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
