## üì¢ About
The focus of this workshop is to use a Convolutional Neural Network-based image manipulation method called Neural Style Transfer as a vehicle to introduce basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts to students with little to no experience in the subject.  

## üí° Project Information

* <b>Needed Materials:</b> Computer, Google Colab account 
* <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> The primary goal of this project is to break down key AI concepts needed to understand the inner workings of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and encourage discussions about the social and ethical impact of incorporating AI models in our daily life. 
* <b>Your Main Technology: </b> Google Colab
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) <b>(TAP)</b> is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## üìÉ Project Description
Workshop structure:
1. Visual explanation of object recognition by computers
2. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Filters and feature maps
3. Introduction to Neural Style Transfer (NST), an application of a Convolutional Neural Network model
4. Apply NST to content representation learning
5. Apply NST to style representation learning
6. Hands-on activity: Use NST to generate a new image
7. Discussion about the social impact and ethical considerations of AI
