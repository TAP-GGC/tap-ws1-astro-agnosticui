## About

The objective of the workshop is to use mBots to teach basic coding and debugging.  
Participants will observe a demo of how code is intended to make the mBot react, then receive "broken code" to debug using block-based logic.  
Students will be divided into groups focused on RGB lights, speed/distance, and turning/lateral movement. After mastering their tasks, they’ll work together in teams to complete a timed track challenge.

## Project Information

* **Difficulty Level:** Beginner  
* **Target Audience:** K-12 and college students  
* **Duration of Workshop:** 30 - 90 minutes  
* **Needed Materials:** Tablets, mBot Mega, mBlock software, Cardboard Maze  
* **Learning Outcomes:**
  Understand how to debug and fix block-based code
  Learn robotic motion concepts (speed, direction, lights)
  Apply programming logic to physical problem-solving
* **Main Technology:** mBot Mega  
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) (TAP) is a project-based class fostering a collaborative environment for students to develop semester-long projects. TAP promotes IT participation through outreach activities and workshops designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## Technology

#### mBot Mega  
<Logo src={mBotImage.src} alt="mBot Mega robot" />
[mBot Mega](https://www.makeblock.com/steam-kits/mbot-mega) is a programmable robot car with mechanical wheels capable of omni-directional movement. Great for teaching coding and robotics.


**Why we chose mBot Mega:**  
Its physical presence makes learning fun and interactive while teaching real-world coding concepts.

**Why we chose mBlock:**  
Its drag-and-drop interface lowers the barrier for beginners while introducing programming logic in a visual, intuitive way.
