## About

The objective of the workshop is to showcase how users can turn their ideas into art with the help of Artificial Intelligence.
This interactive workshop allows participants to explore the combination of creativity, AI, and programming through art. Using tools like Processing, Java, and DALL-E, participants create personalized images based on their input and then color and design their ideas on an interactive canvas.

## Project Information

* **Difficulty Level:** Beginner  
* **Target Audience:** All ages 
* **Duration of Workshop:** 30 - 60 minutes
* **Needed Materials:** Computer or laptop with a keyboard and mouse/trackpad  
* **Learning Outcomes:**
  - The primary goal of this project is to teach participants how to combine creativity with technology.
  - Students will learn how to craft effective prompts to guide AI and experiment with different ways of structuring their prompts.
  - Students will learn how to create and manipulate colors digitally using the RGB model.
* **Main Technology:** JAVA, Processing, DALL-E  
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) (TAP) is a project-based class fostering a collaborative environment for students to develop semester-long projects. TAP promotes IT participation through outreach activities and workshops designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

## Technology

#### Processing
<Image src={ProcessingLogo} alt="UnityLogo"/>
[Processing](https://processing.org/) uses Java programming language and is used for making visuals and interactive graphics.

#### Aesprite
<Image src={DallELogo} alt="AsepriteLogo"/>
[DALL-E](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555480-dall-e-3-api) is an AI model that generates images from textual descriptions. It will be used to create art templates based on participant-provided prompts.


Why we chose Processing: It is easy to use and helps participants create interactive and visual art while learning programming concepts. This makes it ideal for engaging participants in both art and coding.

Why we chose DALL-E: It allows for fast and creative image generation based on participant prompts, making the process fun, interactive, and highly engaging.
