{/* Project description */}	

* Our project uses the **Makey Makey** invention kit to teach the basics of circuits and programming in a fun and creative way. Students design custom instrument layouts (e.g. banana piano, playdough drums) that connect to their computer and interact with our Godot application. 
This hands-on activity helps them explore electrical circuits, user input, and the logic of event-driven programming.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) aims to make IT accessible and engaging for all students through creative outreach workshops.
