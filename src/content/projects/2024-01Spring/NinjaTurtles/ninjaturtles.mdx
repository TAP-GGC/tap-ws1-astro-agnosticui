{/* Right text block, Project description */}	
 The two primary goals of this project is teaching the students the basics of Scratch and giving them a crash course on algorithms.
 Scratch is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an educational tool for children. Through our classroom workshops and outreach activities, students get to learn how to program character movement and sprite animation in Scratch, using the fundamental programming concepts such as variables, if-else statements, and loops. These experiences will help them develop problem-solving and logical reasoning skills that can be applied to other programming languages as well as other fields outside of computing. Through this project, we hope to increase interest and participation in STEM; and show that learning how to program can be fun and creative.
 The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

  ## Steps:

  1. Opening a blank Scratch page by:
  2. Go to the Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu
  3. Click on Create in the top left corner of the screen.
  4. A blank Scratch workspace will pop up.
  5. Getting to the game
  6. Go to the Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu
  7. Using the Search bar, type in "The Ninja Turtles". Note that Scratch is very picky, so it's important to use the exact same search key.
  8. Click on Studios, then select this studio as shown in the picture below.
  9. Select TAP Workshop.
  10. Select the full screen option, then press the green flag to start playing the game.
