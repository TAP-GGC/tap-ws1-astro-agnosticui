This workshop has participants follow along with hands-on activities, where they build simple scenes and learn how to use Unity's tools and C# scripting to bring their ideas to life. By the end, participants will have created their own small interactive project while gaining practical skills.

[Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) <b>(TAP)</b> is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.
