# Our First Teachers' Workshop

On May 10, 2024, the Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP) at Georgia Gwinnett College’s School of Science and Technology (SST) proudly hosted its first-ever Teachers Technology Workshop — a special event held during Teacher Appreciation Week to honor the educators shaping the minds and futures of tomorrow.

With generous support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), this inaugural workshop offered K–12 teachers an opportunity to explore fun, engaging ways to introduce programming and algorithmic thinking into their classrooms. Through hands-on activities and dynamic project ideas, TAP aimed to support educators in building confidence with computer science concepts and tools they can take directly to their students.

We are especially grateful to Jessica King Holden, Laura Gray, Brenda McDaniel, and Sallie Holloway from Gwinnett County Public Schools, and to Amy Sol from NGF, for helping us promote this workshop and connect with so many dedicated teachers.

Special thanks also go to Dean Chavonda Mills, Ph.D., and the Georgia Gwinnett College School of Science and Technology, for their invaluable support in making this event possible.

Of course, none of this could have happened without our phenomenal TAP team. Deep thanks to faculty members Cindy Robertson, Tirza Leader, Dr. Rahaf Barakat, Cengiz Gunay, Wei Jin, and Xin Xu for their leadership and vision.

And to our amazing student assistants —
Ammar Mehicevic, Kevin Rubio, Kelechi Ariwodo, Trung Dao, Carina George, Nguyên Anh Tăng, Julissa Valdez-Ramos, Sean Nolan, Danielle Mathieu, and Tony Lam — thank you for the energy, organization, and heart you poured into this event.

To our passionate and engaged workshop participants: thank you for making this kickoff workshop such a success. Your curiosity and enthusiasm lit up every session, and we’re honored to support your journey into teaching tech.

With this strong start, we’re already looking forward to our next event in September 2024. Let’s continue building a future where every classroom is a launchpad for innovation.
