<Photo src={spring24Network.src} alt="Alumni & Student Networking Night"/>  
Georgia Gwinnett College School of Science and Technology, Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP) faculty were excited to host the 4th "TAP Career Development Panel and Networking Event" on March 25th. This event is part of a series of networking events for our current and former TAP students.

We would like to thank our IT Chair, Dr. Sean Yang for attending and providing the opening remarks. We greatly appreciate his continued support and the SST officeâ€™s support for the TAP program. 

Many thanks to our wonderful alumni (Khadijah Nixon, Ayesha H. Syeda, Eric Jenkins, Patrick Page, Jessica Wheeler, and Michael Murillo-Martinez) who provided insight and guidance to our students as they begin to think about their future career opportunities.
We would also like to thank all of our event participants for their enthusiasm and interest that made this event successful.
