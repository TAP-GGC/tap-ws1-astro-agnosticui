# Atlanta Science Festival 
### Spring 2025

Every spring, Atlanta bursts into bloom—and not just with flowers, but with curiosity, creativity, and cutting-edge ideas at the **Atlanta Science Festival**. This year, students from the **Technology Ambassador’s Program** stepped into the spotlight, hosting interactive booths to showcase their own tech-powered projects.

From robotics and coding demos to digital design and app development, these student innovators transformed Piedmont Park into a hub of hands-on discovery. It wasn’t just about showing off what they’d built—it was about *inviting the city to build with them.*

With over 100 events citywide, the Festival is a celebration of science, tech, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM)—but it’s also a place where students become leaders, teachers, and dreamers. And thanks to the Tech Ambassadors, visitors got a firsthand look at the next generation of changemakers in action.

At its heart, the Festival—and the Ambassadors’ presence within it—reminds us: science isn’t just something we study. It’s something we *do together.*

So here’s to the future, coded in collaboration and curiosity.

Georgia Gwinnett College's TAP (Technology Ambassador Program) students proudly participated in the Atlanta Science Festival, on March 22nd. The kids had fun experiencing several technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.
