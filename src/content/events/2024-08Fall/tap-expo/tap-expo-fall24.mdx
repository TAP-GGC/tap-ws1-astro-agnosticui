Georgia Gwinnett College School of Science and Technology, Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP) faculty (Xin Xu, Cindy Robertson, Cengiz Gunay, Wei Jin, Tirza Leader, and Anca Doloc-Mihu) were excited to host the 3rd TAP Career Development Panel and Networking Event on Oct 24. This event is part of a series of networking events for our current and former TAP students.

We would like to thank Dean Joseph Ametepe for attending and providing the opening remarks. We greatly appreciate his continued support and the SST officeâ€™s support for the TAP program. 

Many thanks to our wonderful alumni (Samuel Groom, Hugh Smith, Joshua "Mart" Miller, Jessica (Sok) Yeap, Veronica Ichor, Katrina Smith, Jose Moreno, Keyvan Shabani, and Joseph Ongchangco) who traveled from near and far to provide insight and guidance to our students as they begin to think about their future career opportunities.
We would also like to thank all of our event participants for their enthusiasm and interest that made this event successful.
