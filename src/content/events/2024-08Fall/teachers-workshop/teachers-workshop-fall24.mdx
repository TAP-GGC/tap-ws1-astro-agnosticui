# Our Second Teachers' Workshop

<Photo src={group_1.src} alt="Group photo at the grizzly bear statue"/>  


On September 13, 2024, the Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP) at Georgia Gwinnett College’s School of Science and Technology (SST) proudly hosted its Second Teachers Technology Workshop — an inspiring and hands-on day dedicated to K–12 educators from across the region.

This year’s workshop focused on empowering teachers with fun, creative, and accessible ways to bring programming and algorithmic thinking into their classrooms. By blending interactive learning with real-world classroom strategies, TAP continues its mission of supporting teachers as they help students build the foundational skills of tomorrow’s tech leaders.

We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support from Gwinnett County Public Schools and NGF. Special thanks to Sallie Holloway, Jessica King Holden, Laura Gray, and Amy Sol for championing this event and helping make it a success.

Behind the scenes, the workshop came to life thanks to the incredible efforts of our dedicated TAP faculty and staff. A heartfelt thank-you to Xin Xu, Cindy Robertson, Tirza Leader, Cengiz Gunay, Wei Jin, and our phenomenal student assistants:
Ammar Mehicevic, Elijah Santiago, Trung Dao, Carina George, Anh Tang, Julissa Valdez-Ramos, and Sean Nolan — your passion and dedication truly shone.

We also extend appreciation to Charles Pibel, Joseph Ametepe, and the SST office staff for their instrumental support in organizing the event.

Most importantly, we thank the 22 amazing teachers who joined us. Your curiosity, energy, and commitment to your students made this workshop not just productive, but inspiring.

Finally, a big thank-you to our generous sponsor, the National Science Foundation (NSF), for making this experience possible.

✨ Mark your calendars — we’ll be back in March 2025 with even more opportunities to connect, create, and code together. Stay tuned!
